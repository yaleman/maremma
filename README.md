## Development testing and stuff

There's a bunch of "live" tests that you need to set environment variables for, because I'm not telling everyone which hosts and checks I run locally :)

Here's the (as of 2024-08-24) envs:

- MAREMMA_TEST_SSH_HOST
- MAREMMA_TEST_KUBE_HOST
- MAREMMA_TEST_SSH_HOST
- MAREMMA_TEST_SSH_USERNAME
- MAREMMA_TEST_SSH_KEY
